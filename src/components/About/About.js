                <p>Hello there! My name is Corey and I'm a photographer from the Phoenix, AZ area.</p>

                <p>I enjoy each type of photography for it's own specific nuances, but my favorite has to be portraits. I love being able to capture a personal moment someone has at a given time and be able to store it for the rest of time.</p>

                <p>I'm a huge fan of music, collecting records, film + television, traveling, my nephew, and getting to know people 
                from all walks of life. I am also a graduate of Arizona State University (fork â€˜em devils)!</p>

                <p>Let's create something amazing together soon.</p>

                <p>Much love.</p>
